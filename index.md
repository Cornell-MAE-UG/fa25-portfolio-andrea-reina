## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell with experience in CAD, analysis, and experimental testing. I enjoy collaborative projects that combine design, manufacturing, and data-driven evaluation. This repository contains work from a wind turbine blade design project, including modeling, testing, and performance analysis.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
